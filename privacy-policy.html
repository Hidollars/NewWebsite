These include:<br>‍<br><strong>Consent</strong> <br>We can collect and process your data with your consent. For example, when we are processing sensitive or special personal data, such as information relating to your health or religious beliefs.  In many circumstances, if we rely on your consent as our legal basis for processing your personal data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.<br><strong><br>Contractual obligations<br>‍</strong>In many circumstances, we require your personal data to comply with contractual obligations. For example, we collect your identity and contact information when we verify you as a new customer.  If you are unable to provide such information to us, we may not be able to perform the contract we have with you or your organisation or enter into a contract with you or your organisation.<br><strong><br>Legal compliance</strong> <br>If the law requires us to, we may need to collect and process your personal data.  For example, we may require your personal data to comply with anti-money laundering legislation or laws relating to the provision of legal services.  If you are unable to provide such information to us, we may not be able to perform the contract we have with you or your organisation or enter into a contract with you or your organisation.<br>‍<br><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> <br>In many situations, we require your personal data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact on your rights, freedoms or interests.
