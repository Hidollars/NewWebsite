            <p class="faq-answer-text">Know Your Customer (KYC) is a standard practice for any company offering
                financial services. Identity verification as part of KYC protects our members against fraud, money
                laundering and illegal activities in our ecosystem. Financial platforms are required by law to collect
                this data from their customers and avoid the attempt of these types of financial crimes as part of
                anti-money laundering (AML) measures.<br><br>
                For <span class="hi">hi</span> members, KYC will consist of submitting photos of a personal identification
                document, address proof, and selfie. We use a partner to assist with the collection and secure store of
                this information. Further details about KYC will be provided soon.<br><br>
                In order to claim your referral rewards, purchase <span class="hi">hi</span> Dollars, and/or withdraw money
                from <span class="hi">hi</span> , you must pass a basic know-your-customer (KYC) check. </p>
