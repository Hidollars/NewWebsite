    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p class="faq-answer-text">Fiat/Traditional currency is “legal tender” backed by a “central government.” It can take the form of physical dollars (e.g. paper Federal Reserve notes), or it can be represented electronically, such as with bank credit. A government controls the supply. Common examples include the US dollar, the Euro, and the Japanese Yen.<br/><br>
        Digital/Crypto currency  is not “legal tender” and it is not backed by a central government or bank (it is decentralized and global). An algorithm or smart contract controls the supply. Common examples include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.
