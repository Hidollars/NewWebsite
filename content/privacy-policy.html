    <p class="pp-terms-text">We are hi Foundation Limited, a non-profit limited by guarantee incorporated in Singapore
        with the address 3 Fraser Street, DUO Tower, #05-25, Singapore 189352. (“<strong>we</strong>” or
        “<strong>us</strong>”).</p>
    <p class="pp-terms-text">Your privacy is important to us. We are
        committed to protecting the privacy, confidentiality, and security of the personal data we hold by complying
        with the requirements under applicable laws and regulations. We are
        equally committed to ensuring that all our employees, service providers and agents uphold these
        obligations. When you engage us to provide services for you, we will
        be the “data controller” for your personal data.</p>
    <p class="pp-terms-text">This policy explains how we collect, use, process, manage and disclose personal data within
        our organisation.</p>
    <p class="pp-title"><strong>Explaining the legal basis we rely upon to process your personal information</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="pp-terms-text">Data protection laws set out various grounds on which an organisation may lawfully collect
        and process your personal data. These include:</p>
    <p class="pp-terms-text"><em>Consent</em></p>
    <p class="pp-terms-text">We can collect and process your data with your consent. For example, when we are processing
        sensitive or special personal data, such as information relating to your health or religious beliefs. In many
        circumstances, if we rely on your consent as our legal basis
        for processing your personal data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.</p>
    <p class="pp-terms-text"><em>Contractual obligations</em></p>
    <p class="pp-terms-text">In many circumstances, we require your personal data to comply with contractual
        obligations. For example, we collect your identity and contact information when we verify you as a new
        customer. If you are unable to provide such information to us, we may
        not be able to perform the contract we have with you or your organisation or enter into a contract with you or
        your organisation.</p>
    <p class="pp-terms-text"><em>Legal compliance</em></p>
    <p class="pp-terms-text">If the law requires us to, we may need to collect and process your personal data. For
        example, we may require your personal data to comply with
        anti-money laundering legislation or laws relating to the provision of legal services. If you are unable to
        provide such information to us, we may not be
        able to perform the contract we have with you or your organisation or enter into a contract with you or your
        organisation.</p>
    <p class="pp-terms-text"><em>Legitimate interests</em></p>
    <p class="pp-terms-text">In many situations, we require your personal data to pursue our legitimate interests in a
        way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact on
        your rights, freedoms or interests. For example, it may be in our
        legitimate interests to use your personal information for marketing purposes to assist us with the growth of our
        business.</p>
    <p class="pp-terms-text">Data protection laws do vary across the different jurisdictions in which we operate. Please
        contact us if you require details of the specific legal ground
        we are relying on to process your personal data.</p>

        the jurisdictions in which we operate.</p>
    <em>Request access to the personal data we hold about you</em>
    <p class="pp-terms-text">If you want to access any of the personal data that we hold about you or to correct some
        aspect of it (for example, because you think it is incomplete or incorrect), please contact our privacy
        compliance team using the contact details set out below. To protect
        the integrity and security of the information we hold, we may ask that you follow a defined access procedure,

        may charge you an administration fee for providing you with access to the information you have asked for, but we
        will inform you of this before proceeding. There may be cases where
        we are unable to provide the information you request, such as where it would interfere with the privacy of
        others or result in a breach of confidentiality. In these cases we
        will let you know why we cannot comply with your request.</p>
    <p class="pp-terms-text">Even if you do not request access to and/or correct your personal data held by us, if we
        are satisfied that, having regard to the reasons for
        which we hold your personal data, that personal data is inaccurate, incomplete, out-of-date, irrelevant or
        misleading, we may take reasonable steps to correct that information.</p>
    <p class="pp-terms-text">For EU residents, we will do this for no fee, in accordance with applicable legislation.

        residents, whenever you have given us your consent to use your
        personal data, you have the right to change your mind at any time and withdraw that consent. In cases where we
        are processing your personal data on the basis of
        our legitimate interests, you can ask us to stop processing your data for reasons connected to your individual
        situation. We must then do so unless we believe we have a legitimate
        overriding reason to continue processing your personal data.</p>
    <em>Right to data portability</em>
    <p class="pp-terms-text">In certain circumstances, you may have the right to obtain your personal data in a
        structured, commonly used and machine readable format and to reuse it elsewhere or ask us to transfer it to a
        third party of your choice.</p>
    <em>Right to object</em>
    <p class="pp-terms-text">In certain circumstances, you have a right to object to processing being carried out by
        us. Where personal data is being processed for direct marketing
        purposes, you have a right to object at any time</p>
    <em>Rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling</em>
    <p class="pp-terms-text">In certain circumstances, you have a right not to be subject to a decision which is based
        on automated processing where the decision will produce a legal effect or a similarly significant effect on you.
    </p>
    <p class="pp-terms-text">To protect the confidentiality of your information, we will require you to verify your
        identity before proceeding with any request. If you have authorised a
